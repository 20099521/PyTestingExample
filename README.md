# This is simple test repository for automated testing.

This repository is used for automated testing as described on the [CodeRefinery Testing Lecture](https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/continuous-integration/).

If you follow the instructions on that page, you can use this repository as a basis for the exercise and skip Steps 1 and 2. Simply [fork] (https://github.com/AaltoRSE/PyTestingExample/fork) it to your own github repositories, make a local clone
```
git clone https://github.com/<yourGitHubName>/PyTestingExample
```
and then follow steps 3.-9. in the instructions.

The "Solution" branch contains a version with all tests corrected and set up along with a template for the github action necessary.
